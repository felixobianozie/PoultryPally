## The Inspiration üå§Ô∏è
In my [(Felix Obianozie)](felixobianozie@gmail.com) demographic, there are more poultry farmers than there are of any other livestock. On the fateful day, my nextdoor neigbour who has a bird farm expressed some frustration over not getting the right tool to manage her farm. "...they either are just too complex and overpriced or too simple to fit my needs as a small/medium scale everyday farmer." Those were her exact words when I inquired about the already existing tools. I thought, "a Software Engineer is a problem solver right?" The thought led to something, which led to another, and here we are...</smiles>.
